              Our platform leverages a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
              trained on annotated endoscopic images to detect early signs of
              gastric cancer. By highlighting suspicious regions in just seconds,
              we aim to assist clinicians in making faster, more accurate
              diagnoses.

              Built on Intel Tiber Cloud‚Äôs AI accelerators, our model processes
              high-resolution imagery with low latency, ensuring real-time
              feedback during endoscopic procedures. The interface is designed to
              be intuitive, presenting heatmaps and confidence scores alongside
              each frame.

              This project was developed by the ACM Hack team at SCU, combining
              expertise in medical imaging, deep learning, and cloud-native
              deployment. Our goal is to democratize access to AI-powered cancer
              screening tools and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
